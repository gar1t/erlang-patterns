# Erlang Patterns

Please note that
[http://erlangpatterns.org](http://erlangpatterns.org) is no longer
maintained. Don't look for actual Erlang patterns there - it's
something else now.

This repo should be migrated to use GitHub pages so it can be viewed
as a proper website. The original site was generated with LambdaPad,
which is also no longer maintained.

If anyone wants to migrate this to GitHub pages, that would be
extremely helpful!
